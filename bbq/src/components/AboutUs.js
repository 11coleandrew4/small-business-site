      <p>
        As if you didn’t know by now, The BBQ Pit is a family owned and run
        business. My late father, Frank Karigan established The BBQ Pit in 1978.
        Our original location was around the corner on First Ave. Many of you
        reading this remember its “joint” type atmosphere. The location is all
        that has changed, really. The meat of our menu is still the same with
        additions every so often to keep up with changing habits. The Chicago
        Tribune, Chicago Sun-Times, Chicago Magazine and North Shore Magazine
        consistently recognize our BBQ Ribs as the best. Those accolades are
        wonderful, but what we are most proud of is the relationships we have
        established with you, our customer. Our business survives on local and
        repeat clientele. You can always count on seeing myself or some family
        member when walking in. At some point during your visit, I will try to
        stop by your table and say “Hello”. In a growing world of big box
        restaurant chains, fast food sandwiches and the like; I’m proud to say
        we are the last of a dying breed and we thank you for recognizing that
        these types of establishments still have a place in your life. We live
        in a busy world and I am honored to have you here to hang your hat and
        eat a good ole’ home cooked meal. <br /> <br />
        Thanks,
        <br />
        Gus
